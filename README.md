# Art School Event Landing Page

Developed a zero-cost, interactive landing page for an art school opening event, designed by artist Adam Wellingstein.


## Features:
- **Interactive Animation**: User-activated inflating-letters effect via `Matter.js`.
- **Form-to-Google Sheets**: A form where students input projects, automatically updating a Google Sheet.

## Zero-Cost Operation:
- Webpage hosted on **GitHub Pages**.
- Backend powered by **Google's Apps-Script**.

> Note: This small project was my initial dive into web development, with no prior experience.
